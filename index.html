	<h2>About me</h2>
	I am a masters student in Computer Science in the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am learning the art of building large-scale applications.

	<h2>Education</h2>
	I am currently pursuing masters in computer science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am specializing in systems primarily. (Courses: <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/cs764/CS764-F19.html">Topics in Database Management Systems</a>, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shivaram/cs744-fa19/">Big Data Systems</a>, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/CS640/F19/">Computer Networks</a>)
	 Before my master, I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University, Chennai. I graduated with 3rd rank in the department. Apart from academics, I took part in various programming contests held during that period.

During that period, I did my internships in Amazon and Morgan Stanley, and they gave me very good industry exposure which changed my learning methodology after I went back to school.

	<p id = "experience">
	<h2>Experience</h2>
	
	Before joining masters, I worked in PayPal. There I had an opportunity to work on large scale systems which I got interested further and encouraged me to specialize further in this area during my masters.

	<h2>Projects</h2>
	I have worked on some of big data projects and data analytics projects.
	<p><h3>Music Recommender System using Multi-Node Hadoop Cluster</h3>
	We used a hybrid method for recommending songs from the dataset in the hdfs to overcome some of the disadvantages of filtering techniques when used in isolation. For content-based filtering, K-means clustering was used to cluster the songs and Pearson correlation coefficient for collaboration based filtering to find the similarity among users.
	</p>
	<p>
	<h3>Automatic Lyric Generation based on Neuro-Linguistics</h3>
	A research project for extending the lyric generation model (ontology graph) to generate lyrics based on author's stylometry and the backdrop context in the lyric. Word statistics for authors were built by parsing their previous works and object detection was used to build backdrop context (Caffe framework was used) and use it in the lyric.

	<h2> Technology Interests</h2>
	Apart from academics, I love to read about technology and latest developments and show some special interest in medium blog
	related to technology and some good answers in Quora to view the technology from writer's perspective.

	If some field interests me more, then I used to take some courses in coursera to get more perspective on it. (Coursera courses: 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/88TJXSZPZ4YA">Big Data and Applications in the Cloud</a>, 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/9PZTSBKSGJS7">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>).
	<br>
	Sometimes reading tech books which talks about some evolution of a field or showing author's thoughts (
	<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24612233-the-master-algorithm"> The Master Algorithm</a>, 
	<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence"> Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies </a>) will occupy my some weekends.

	<p id = "quotes">
	<h2>Quotes and Life Philosophies</h2>
	I am interested in reading some of the life philosophies or quotes which shapes my mind in many of my decision-making process. It also helped me both academically and professionally.
	Some ideas that I love,
